## Key distinguishing features
- Listing all discrete meeting slots as individual columns: each includes day of week, day of month, month, start/end time, and a checkbox for users to indicate their availability.
- Initialization of all meeting slot availability (via each slot's checkboxes) to empty/"not available"
- Each checkbox is color-coordinated, tri-state, and with cyclical states, in which users can indicate complete availability (green if clicks \mod 3 = 1), tentative availability (yellow if clicks \mod 3 = 2), or no availability (if clicks \mod 3 = 0)

## Running the prototype
- Pull the code from this public repo!
- In VSCode, go to the index.html file and click the 4th icon down in the left sidebar. The prototype should open directly in your default browser!
- Alternatively, install the [Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode. After the plugin is installed, go to the index.html file and right-click anywhere in the text editor. Within the dropdown menu, there will be an option titled "Open with Live Server". Clicking it should open the prototype in your default browser!
